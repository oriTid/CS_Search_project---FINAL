DB :
    General:
    
        My DB contains 2 tables: Searches , Search_Results.
        
        Searches - contains 3 columns :
        1) SearchID - with Identity True, is th PK
        2) SearchTerm - will hold the search term that the user typed
        3) SearchDate - to hold the search date of the specific search (the program will insert it to the DB)
        
        Search_Results - contains 3 columns :
        1) ID - with Identity True, is th PK (not being used in the Project)
        2) SearchID - will hold the searchID that was created in the searches table (the program will insert it to the DB)
        3) SearchResultPath - will hold all the pathes that the search term was found in (the program will insert it to the DB)
        
        
   Create the DB :
   
       Files for creating the DB located in the "DB Creation" folder
       https://github.com/oriTid/CS_Search_project---FINAL/tree/master/DB%20Creation
       
       You have 2 options for creating the:
       
       1) Restore CS_Search_DB.bak
       2) Run Script CS_Search_DB.sql on SQL Server
       
       
  Updating the Data-Connection in the program:
  
        After DB is created, you will need to update the Data-Connection, in order for the program to work properly.
        The connection is set in the CTOR of SearchLogic class located in the BLL.
        
        public SearchLogic() //ctor
        {
            DBmanager.myDataConnctionString = "Data Source=devps2010;Initial Catalog=CS_Search_Project_Ori;Integrated Security=True"; //set data connection string in DAL from the ctor
        }
        
        Please dont forget to update it before running the program.
